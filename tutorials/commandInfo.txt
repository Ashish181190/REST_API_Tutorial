1) Safe = False
    The safe boolean parameter defaults to True.
    If it's set to False, any object can be passed for serialization (otherwise only dict instances are allowed).

2) __icontains
    Case-insensitive containment test.

3) many=True
    it tell that queryset contains mutiple items (a list of items) so drf needs to serialize each item with serializer class (and serializer.data will be a list)
    if you don't set this argument it means queryset is a single instance and serializer.data will be a single object)
